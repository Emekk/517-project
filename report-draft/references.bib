abstract = {Reverse distribution, or the management of product return flows, induced by various forms of reuse of products and materials, has received growing attention throughout this decade. In this paper we discuss reverse distribution, and propose a mathematical programming model for a version of this problem. Due to the complexity of the proposed model, we introduce a heuristic solution methodology for this problem. The solution methodology complements a heuristic concentration procedure, where sub-problems with reduced sets of decision variables are iteratively solved to optimality. Based on the solutions from the sub-problems, a final concentration set of potential facility sites is constructed, and this problem is solved to optimality. The potential facility sites are then expanded in a greedy fashion to obtain the final solution. This “heuristic expansion” was also performed using the solution found with a greedy heuristic to provide a short-list of potential facility sites. Computational tests demonstrate a great deal of promise for this solution method, as high-quality solutions are obtained while expending modest computational effort.}

abstract = {Traditionally, product returns have been viewed as an unavoidable cost of doing business, forfeiting any chance of cost savings. As cost pressures continue to mount in this era of economic downturns, a growing number of firms have begun to explore the possibility of managing product returns in a more cost-efficient manner. However, few studies have addressed the problem of determining the number and location of centralized return centers (i.e., reverse consolidation points) where returned products from retailers or end-customers were collected, sorted, and consolidated into a large shipment destined for manufacturers’ or distributors’ repair facilities. To fill the void in such a line of research, this paper proposes a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model and a genetic algorithm that can solve the reverse logistics problem involving product returns. The usefulness of the proposed model and algorithm was validated by its application to an illustrative example dealing with products returned from online sales.}

abstract = {Collection and recycling of product returns is gaining interest in business and research worldwide. Growing green concerns and advancement of green supply chain management (GrSCM) concepts and practices make it all the more relevant. Inputs from literature and informal interviews with 84 stakeholders are used to develop a conceptual model for simultaneous location–allocation of facilities for a cost effective and efficient reverse logistics (RL) network. We cover costs and operations across a wide domain and our proposed RL network consists of collection centers and two types of rework facilities set up by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or their consortia for a few categories of product returns under various strategic, operational and customer service constraints in the Indian context. In this paper, we provide an integrated holistic conceptual framework that combines descriptive modeling with optimization techniques at the methodological level. We also provide detailed solutions for network configuration and design at the topological level, by carrying out experimentation with our conceptual model. Our findings provide useful insights to various stakeholders and suggest avenues for further research.}

abstract = {This study proposes a reverse logistics network involved in the management of municipal solid waste (MSW) to solve the challenge of economically managing these wastes considering the recent legal requirements of the Brazilian Waste Management Policy. The feasibility of the allocation of MSW material recovery facilities (MRF) as intermediate points between the generators of these wastes and the options for reuse and disposal was evaluated, as well as the participation of associations and cooperatives of waste pickers. This network was mathematically modelled and validated through a scenario analysis of the municipality of São Mateus, which makes the location model more complete and applicable in practice. The mathematical model allows the determination of the number of facilities required for the reverse logistics network, their location, capacities, and product flows between these facilities. The fixed costs of installation and operation of the proposed MRF were balanced with the reduction of transport costs, allowing the inclusion of waste pickers to the reverse logistics network. The main contribution of this study lies in the proposition of a reverse logistics network for MSW simultaneously involving legal, environmental, economic and social criteria, which is a very complex goal. This study can guide practices in other countries that have realities similar to those in Brazil of accelerated urbanisation without adequate planning for solid waste management, added to the strong presence of waste pickers that, through the characteristic of social vulnerability, must be included in the system. In addition to the theoretical contribution to the reverse logistics network problem, this study aids in decision-making for public managers who have limited technical and administrative capacities for the management of solid wastes.}

A mixed integer formulation is developed which is solved using standard B\&B techniques. The model is applied to an illustrative case.}

abstract = {Recovery of used products has become increasingly important recently due to economic reasons and growing environmental or legislative concern. Product recovery, which comprises reuse, remanufacturing and materials recycling, requires an efficient reverse logistic network. One of the main characteristics of reverse logistics network problem is uncertainty that further amplifies the complexity of the problem. The degree of uncertainty in terms of the capacities, demands and quantity of products exists in reverse logistics parameters. With consideration of the factors noted above, this paper proposes a probabilistic mixed integer linear programming model for the design of a reverse logistics network. This probabilistic model is first converted into an equivalent deterministic model. In this paper we proposed multi-product, multi-stage reverse logistics network problem for the return products to determine not only the subsets of disassembly centers and processing centers to be opened, but also the transportation strategy that will satisfy demand imposed by manufacturing centers and recycling centers with minimum fixed opening cost and total shipping cost. Then, we propose priority based genetic algorithm to find reverse logistics network to satisfy the demand imposed by manufacturing centers and recycling centers with minimum total cost under uncertainty condition. Finally, we apply the proposed model to a numerical example.}

abstract = {This work is concerned with the efficient design of a reverse logistics network using an extended version of models currently found in the literature. Those traditional, basic models are formulated as mixed integer linear programs (MILP-model) and determine which facilities to open that minimize the investment, processing, transportation, disposal and penalty costs while supply, demand and capacity constraints are satisfied. However, we show that they can be improved when they are combined with a queueing model because it enables to account for (1) some dynamic aspects like lead time and inventory positions, and (2) the higher degree of uncertainty inherent to reverse logistics. Since this extension introduces nonlinear relationships, the problem is defined as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP-model). Due to this additional complexity, the MINLP-model is presented for a single product-single-level network. Several examples are solved with a genetic algorithm based on the technique of differential evolution.}
